## Development Environment

This program was developed using Visual Studio Code with the GCC compiler installed through MSYS2 on a Windows operating system. Visual Studio Code is a popular text editor and Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that provides many features for developing and debugging code. The GCC compiler is a widely used compiler for C and C++ languages, and MSYS2 is a package manager for Windows that provides a convenient way to install and manage software.

## Program Explanation

This program defines a `Node` structure with fields for the `type` of operation, the `value` of the node, and pointers to the left and right child nodes. The `TypeTag` enumeration is defined with values for the four basic arithmetic operations (`ADD`, `SUB`, `MUL`, `DIV`).

The `makeFunc` function takes a `TypeTag` value and two integer values as arguments and returns a pointer to a new `Node` object. The function allocates memory for the new `Node` object and its left and right child nodes and initializes their fields with the given values.

The `calc` function takes a pointer to a `Node` object as an argument and returns the result of evaluating the expression represented by the tree rooted at that node. The function uses recursion to evaluate the left and right child nodes and then applies the operation specified by the `type` field of the current node to their values.

The `fib` function takes an integer `n` as an argument and returns the `n`th number in the fibonacci sequence. The function uses Dynamic Programming to calculate the fibonacci numbers efficiently. Dynamic Programming is a technique that breaks down a problem into smaller subproblems and stores the solutions to these subproblems to avoid recalculating them. In this case, the `fib` function uses an array `f` to store the fibonacci numbers and uses a loop to calculate the fibonacci numbers up to `n`. The function uses the `makeFunc` and `calc` functions to create and evaluate an addition expression for each fibonacci number.

The `main` function creates several `Node` objects using the `makeFunc` function and evaluates them using the `calc` function. The function also calls the `fib` function with an argument calculated from these nodes and prints the result.

## Setting up the Development Environment

1. Install Visual Studio Code.
2. Install the C/C++ extension for VS Code. You can install the C/C++ extension by searching for 'c++' in the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`).
3. Get the latest version of Mingw-w64 via MSYS2, which provides up-to-date native builds of GCC, Mingw-w64, and other helpful C++ tools and libraries. You can download the latest installer from the [MSYS2 page](https://www.msys2.org/) or use [this link](http://repo.msys2.org/distrib/x86_64/msys2-x86_64-20210604.exe) to the installer.
4. Follow the Installation instructions on the MSYS2 website to install Mingw-w64. Take care to run each required Start menu and `pacman` command.
5. Install the Mingw-w64 toolchain (`pacman -S --needed base-devel mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain`). Run the `pacman` command in a MSYS2 terminal. Accept the default to install all the members in the toolchain group.

## Compiling and Running C Code in Visual Studio Code with GCC installed through MSYS2

1. Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code by going to `View` > `Terminal`.
2. Navigate to the directory where your C file is located using the `cd` command in the terminal.
3. Compile the C code by typing `gcc -o fib fib.c` in the terminal, where `fib.c` is the name of your C file and `fib` is the name of the output executable file.
4. Run the compiled code by typing `./fib` in the terminal.
